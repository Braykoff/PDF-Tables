# [PDF-Tables](https://raykoff.org/PDF-Tables/)
*Find and extract tables embedded in PDF.*

This web application allows users to extract tables from PDF files and export them as csv file. Users upload a PDF and specify the table and column positions on each page using the interface. Rows are automatically detected based on the positions of text labels within the "index" column. 

If PDFs do not contain a reliable text layer, OCR can be run in the browser, which may take a few 
minutes, depending on the length of the PDF. 

### Structure
This entire project is written in Typescript and is organized as follows:
```
src/        # Source Typescript code
scripts/    # Build and linting scripts
dist/       # Compiled js output
assets/     # Static assets
index.html  # Main HTML entry point
```

### Linting
Linting and type checking can be done with the commands:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```
Linting is done by ESLint (see [scripts/eslint-config.ts](scripts/eslint-config.ts)), typechecking is done by tsc (see [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json)).

### Building
Building can be done by running:
```bash
npm run build
```
Building requires Node.js/npm.

The bundled js file is written to [dist/bundled.min.js](dist/bundled.min.js), the pdf.js worker file is copied to [dist/pdf.worker.min.mjs](dist/pdf.worker.min.mjs). Building will not run if type checking is unsuccessful.

Optionally, a source map can be generated by adding the `--sourcemap` flag.
